## BCS Literature Review

### Body condition scoring
A body condition score (BCS) is a subjective evaluation of animal body fat based on visual or tactile features. Although BCS is a subjective measure, experienced scorers have demonstrated high agreement between their scores (Schr√∂der and Staufenbiel, 2006). According to [DairyNZ](https://www.dairynz.co.nz/animal/body-condition-scoring/how-to-bcs/), there are eight pertinent body features for visual condition scoring. Some of these features can be viewed from an animal's side, whereas other features can be viewed from the animal's rear. These body features are:

- Backbone (viewable from both side and rear)
- Long ribs (viewable from side)
- Short ribs (viewable from side)
- Rump (viewable from side)
- Thigh (viewable from side)
- Hip bones (viewable from rear)
- Pin bones (viewable from rear)
- Tailhead (viewable from rear)

These features are integrated by a scorer into an overall BCS. Although, scores based on only the pelvic and tailhead areas (the hips and pins) are most closely related to overall condition scores (Edmonson et al., 1989), so accurate video capture of the animals' posterior may prove to necessary for good scoring.

The body features used in visual condition scoring are shown in the following images from [DairyNZ](https://www.dairynz.co.nz/animal/body-condition-scoring/how-to-bcs/).

### Current BCS prediction systems




### Depth estimation
Given that x, y, and z, depth information seems useful for BCS prediction. We could estimate depth from tthe 2D image sequences using structure from motion (SfM) as used in topography reconstruction from aerial photos (Mancini et al. 2013) and point cloud constuction of an unknown environment with monocular SLAM (Mur-Artal and Montiel, 2015). The estimated depth information could serve as another channel to be processed in conjunction with our image data. The problem with this approach is that it might violate current patents for depth camera BCS systems, so it is safer/easier to avoid explicitly calculating depth from the image sequences.


### Body weight estimation
Animal body weight prediction and BCS prediction are related problems, so successful image-based approaches for body weight estimation might also be successful when applied to BCS prediction. Gjergji et al. (2020) compared a variety of neural network models on image-based cattle body weight prediction. The authors collected video of the dorsal area of the cattle (in other words, the camera captured data from above the animals), and then trained the models on the resulting animal images. The authors reported that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) performed best. From these results, we can assume that CNN models are a more appropriate choice for BCS prediction than other neural network models (such as recurrent models).
