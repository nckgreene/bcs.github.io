### Deep learning methods
Gjergji et al. (2020) compared a variety of neural network models on cattle body weight prediction. The authors collected video of the dorsal area of the cattle (in other words, the camera captured data from above the animals), and then trained the models on the resulting animal images. The authors reported that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) performed best. From these results, we can assume that CNN models are a more appropriate choice for BCS prediction than recurrent models (given that cattle weight prediction and BCS prediction are related problems).
